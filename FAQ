Q: when I try to run 'dnetw' I get the message: "shmget: File exists" ?

That means that 'dnetw' can't create his shared memory segment.
First check that there is no other 'dnetw' running. You can only run one 'dnetw'.
Then check that the file '/tmp/dnetw-shmid' do not exist. You can remove it
only if there is no 'dnetw' running.

If the previous conditions are meet and you are using GkrellDnet v0.9 or less,
please upgrade to GkrellDnet v0.10 or better.
