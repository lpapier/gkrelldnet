gkrelldnet is a monitoring system for Distributed.net client (see
www.distributed.net).

To be able to monitor the client progression, you first need to start the dnet
client with my dnet wrapper 'dnetw'.
This wrapper will write activity information in a file. The last line of this
file contain the most recent information.
The line format is (ASCII text):
current contest
work units in input buffer
work units in output buffer
number of cpu
percentage for cpu 1
...

ex (1 cpu): RC5 24 2 1 45
RC5 contest, 24 work units in input buffer, 2 in output buffer, 1 cpu and
45% done in current packet.
ex (2 cpu): OGR 12 8 2 24 78
OGR contest, 12 work units in input buffer, 8 in output buffer, 2 cpu and
24% done in current packet for cpu0, 78% for cpu1.

IMPORTANT: currently only one cpu supported.
VERY IMPORTANT: dnetw only works if you DO NOT redirect the client output to
a file. The client output MUST be stdout.
The wrapper can redirect the output with the 'l' option.

ex: dnetw -l dnet.log /tmp/dnet_monitor_file
this command will monitor the dnet client in /tmp/dnet_monitor_file and
redirect the client output to dnet.log.

ex: dnetw /tmp/dnet_monitor.log
this command will monitor the dnet client in /tmp/dnet_monitor.log file and
print the client output on your terminal.


I have start writing a gkrellm plugin to monitor the dnetw output. But you can write your own monitoring applet (WindowMaker Dock, Gnome/KDE applets or
epplets), I will only work on the wrapper dnetw and the gkrellm plugin.

Sorry, for the moment you only have this ugly README and no web site, but
both the wrapper and the plugin seems stable.
